# Walkthrough

The following is a walkthrough of my interview project submission.

## Libraries used:

Axios - To make it more straightforward to handle errors and to be able to directly access the result inside the response object data property, where fetch involves dealing with 2 promises.

Bootstrap - Lightweight, customizable, and helps you build responsive and mobile friendly wesbites quickly.

Mapbox GL - Open source alternative to Google Maps that is cheaper and allows you to create custom maps that better fit the look of your website.

React CSV to HTML Table - To make displaying a CSV file as a table as simple as possible. Works with Bootstrap via the `tableClassName` prop.

PropTypes

cors

## Decisions made:

use functional components with hooks

fetchData() method for call to backend

styles defined in component files
